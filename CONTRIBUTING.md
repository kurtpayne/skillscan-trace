# Contributing to skillscan-trace

Thank you for contributing. This document covers the development workflow, CI requirements, and the branch protection settings that enforce them.

---

## Development workflow

All changes — including those from automated agents — go through a pull request. Direct pushes to `main` are blocked by branch protection rules.

```
# 1. Create a feature or fix branch
git checkout -b fix/describe-the-change

# 2. Make changes, then verify locally before pushing
ruff check .
ruff format --check .
mypy skillscan_trace/
pytest tests/ -q

# 3. Push and open a PR
git push origin fix/describe-the-change
gh pr create --fill

# 4. CI runs automatically on the PR
# 5. All checks must be green before merging
```

---

## CI checks

Every PR must pass all of the following before it can be merged:

| Check | Command | What it enforces |
|---|---|---|
| **Lint** | `ruff check .` | No unused imports, undefined names, or style violations |
| **Format** | `ruff format --check .` | Consistent code style (equivalent to black) |
| **Type check** | `mypy skillscan_trace/` | No type annotation errors |
| **Tests** | `pytest tests/ -q` | All unit and integration tests pass |

Run all four locally before pushing:

```bash
ruff check . && ruff format --check . && mypy skillscan_trace/ && pytest tests/ -q
```

## Branch protection settings

The following settings are configured on `main` in **GitHub → Settings → Branches → Branch protection rules**:

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Require a pull request before merging | ✅ Enabled | Prevents direct pushes to `main` |
| Required status checks | `test (3.11)`, `test (3.12)`, `Lint & format` | CI must be green before merge |
| Require branches to be up to date before merging | ✅ Enabled | Prevents stale-branch merges that pass CI but break `main` |
| Do not allow bypassing the above settings | ✅ Enabled | Applies to admins and bots too |
| Allow force pushes | ❌ Disabled | Preserves commit history |
| Allow deletions | ❌ Disabled | Prevents accidental `main` deletion |

**To configure these settings yourself:**
1. Go to `https://github.com/kurtpayne/skillscan-trace/settings/branches`
2. Click **Add branch protection rule** (or edit the existing `main` rule)
3. Set **Branch name pattern** to `main`
4. Enable the settings in the table above
5. Under **Require status checks to pass before merging**, search for and select: `test (3.11)`, `test (3.12)`, `Lint & format`
6. Click **Save changes**

## Commit message format

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>: <short description>

<optional body>
```

Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`.

Examples:
- `feat: add temporal trigger detection rule (MAL-055)`
- `fix: resolve mypy no-any-return in skill_schema`
- `docs: update CONTRIBUTING with branch protection steps`

---

## Adding new detection rules

1. Add the rule entry to `src/skillscan/data/rules/default.yaml` inside `static_rules`
2. Add a showcase example in `examples/showcase/<N>_<rule_id>_<slug>/SKILL.md`
3. Add a test assertion in `tests/test_showcase_examples.py`
4. Run `python3 scripts/sync-website-rules.py` to update the website TSX files
5. Append the showcase to `examples/showcase/INDEX.md`
6. Open a PR — CI will validate the YAML parses and the showcase fires the rule
